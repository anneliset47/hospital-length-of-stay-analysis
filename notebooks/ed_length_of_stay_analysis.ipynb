    "The goal of emergency departments is to see as many sick patients as possible in as short of a time. However, emergency departments are notorious for being overcrowded with prolonged lengths of stay. This puts a major strain on not only patients who need care, but also physicians and the hospital as a whole. Length of stay, also known as LOS can be used as a quality metric to compare hospitals processing times. \"The process within the ED usually starts with the admission of the emergency patient, followed by acuity assessment (triage), diagnosis, treatment initiation, and decisions on discharge or further inpatient treatment\" (NCBI). Hospitals with low LOS indicate high operation efficiency, while hospitals with high LOS indicate low operation efficiency. The purpose of this project is to answer the research question- what factors drive emergency department length of stay, and how well can LOS be predicted?\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this analysis is the \"Emergency Department Length of Stay\" dataset from Kaggle, which consists of fake patient data including demographics, arrival and discharge information, and additional hospital metrics. The main goals of this project are to explore patterns in LOS across key demographic and facility groups, test whether LOS differs between groups using inferential methods, and build predictive models of LOS using linear regression and generalized linear models. \n",
    "\n",
    "To address the research question, exploratory analysis was used to understand the distribution of LOS and its factors. T-tests and ANOVA were used to evaluate group differences in LOS between gender and facility. For predictive modeling, multiple linear regression was ussed to assess the relationship between LOS and clinical factors, like acuity level, number of lab procedures, and comorbidities. Model fit was evaluated using residual diagnositics, AIC, BIC, and MSPE. Gamma generalized lienar model was also for predictive modeling. The linear model and gamma model were compared using diagnostics to assess the models' strength. This analysis ultimately allowed for the exploration of meaningful predictors of ED LOS from a statistical inference and predictive modeling perspective. "

    "The goal of this project was to explore what influences how long patients spend in the emergency department, and to determine which statistical model best captures the variation in length of stay (LOS) across different patient and visit characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with exploratory analysis, I found that LOS is heavily skewed to the right. Most patients are in and out relatively quickly, while a smaller group stays much longer. This pattern reflects what we typically see in real EDs, where many visits are resolved quickly, but some take more time due to more complex care needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial comparisons showed that LOS varies by facility and may differ slightly by gender, which led me to run a few statistical tests. A t-test comparing LOS between male and female patients did not show a meaningful difference. However, a one-way ANOVA revealed that the ED facility significantly impacts LOS. This is likely due to differences in staffing levels, workflow efficiency, and patient volumes across sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "While these group-level tests were informative, they did not account for clinical factors that probably have a bigger influence on LOS. To address this, I moved on to regression modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a multiple linear regression (MLR) model, I found that several clinical variables, including acuity level, number of lab and imaging procedures, and comorbidity count, were strongly associated with LOS. This makes clinical sense, as sicker patients who need more tests generally require longer stays. However, the diagnostics for the MLR showed violations of the normality and constant variance assumptions, which is expected given the skewed, positive-only nature of LOS.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these issues, I fitted a Gamma generalized linear model (GLM) with a log link. This model is a better fit for skewed, strictly positive outcomes like LOS. It also outperformed the linear model in terms of prediction accuracy, showing lower mean squared prediction error and more stable residual patterns. The pseudo-R² indicated that the Gamma model captured meaningful variation in LOS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the Gamma GLM emerged as the most appropriate model, both statistically and conceptually. It showed that clinical complexity, rather than demographic characteristics, is the primary driver of ED LOS. In the future, it could be useful to include interaction effects, time-of-day variables, or operational factors like ED census at arrival. For now, this analysis offers a strong modeling framework for understanding LOS and demonstrates how classical inference and modern regression approaches can work together to analyze healthcare data effectively."
