# Resume Bullets (Copy/Paste Ready)

## Data Analyst Focus

- Built an end-to-end healthcare analytics project on 100,000 ED encounters to identify length-of-stay drivers using EDA, hypothesis testing, and predictive modeling.
- Designed and compared multiple regression specifications with AIC, BIC, and holdout MSPE to balance interpretability and predictive performance.
- Improved model fit for right-skewed, positive outcomes by implementing a Gamma GLM with log link and validating performance via diagnostics and out-of-sample error.
- Produced a recruiter-ready technical report and reproducible analysis assets (notebook, R script conversion, and documentation) for portfolio presentation.

## Data Scientist Focus

- Developed a statistically principled modeling workflow for ED LOS prediction, progressing from baseline MLR to a Gamma GLM aligned to outcome distribution assumptions.
- Engineered data-cleaning rules for physiologic plausibility and type-safe feature preparation across clinical, demographic, and facility-level variables.
- Evaluated generalization using train/test MSPE and model selection metrics, demonstrating robust model comparison in a healthcare operations context.
- Communicated findings as actionable operational insights, highlighting clinical complexity and facility effects as primary LOS drivers.

## Healthcare Analytics Focus

- Analyzed synthetic emergency department encounter data to quantify throughput drivers and support LOS-focused operational decision-making.
- Applied inferential statistics (t-test, ANOVA) to test group-level differences and connect statistical findings to care-flow implications.
- Created reproducible reporting outputs and portfolio artifacts to support stakeholder communication and technical review.
